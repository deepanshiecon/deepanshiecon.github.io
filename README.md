    <p>
      Hi, Iâ€™m currently working as a Research Associate with  <a href="https://aadityadar.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Aaditya Dar (Amazon)</a>. I have a master's degree in Economics from <a href="https://www.jnu.ac.in" target="_blank">Jawaharlal Nehru University</a> and a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from <a href="https://www.sharda.ac" target="_blank">Sharda University</a>. My research interests lie broadly in development economics, with a focus on how policies, institutions, and technological innovations shape economic opportunities for low-income households.
    </p>
    <p>
     I enjoy working with data to make causal inferences that turn numbers into meaningful insights for policy making.
