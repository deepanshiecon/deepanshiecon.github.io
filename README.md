      Hi, Iâ€™m currently working as a Research Assistant with  <a href="https://aadityadar.com/" target="_blank">Dr Aaditya Dar </a>  . I have a masters degree in Economics from <a href="https://www.jnu.ac.in" target="_blank">Jawaharlal Nehru University</a> and a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from <a href="https://www.sharda.ac" target="_blank">Sharda University</a> . I have strong interest in understanding and addressing real-world issues related to climate change, wages, gender, and social inequality.

      I enjoy working with datasets, building models, and translating numbers into stories that matter for people and policy.
